# Deck Battler Command Center

Welcome to the lovingly rebuilt Deck Battler project. This repository delivers a playable auto-battler sandbox, a modern web dashboard, and the foundations for AI experimentation. Every subsystem has been rewritten for clarity and joy â€“ from the combat rules to the development workflow.

## Project Highlights

- **Modular Python engine** â€“ the new `deck_battler` package cleanly separates cards, combat, game state, and agent logic so you can tweak systems without spelunking through a monolith.
- **FastAPI backend** â€“ a lightweight real-time API with WebSocket updates keeps the UI in sync with every shop reroll, combat round, and AI move.
- **React + Tailwind UI** â€“ a polished command center where you can manage your deck, follow combat logs, and monitor both playersâ€™ boards in real time.
- **RL training stack** â€“ use the bundled Gymnasium environment and PPO trainer to develop agents that explore the entire action space, including rerolls, sells, locks, and more.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** (virtual environments highly recommended)
- **Node.js 18+** (ships with npm)

## Backend â€“ FastAPI Service

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn backend:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

   The API is now live at <http://localhost:8000>. Open <http://localhost:8000/docs> for interactive Swagger documentation.

### Useful Endpoints

- `POST /api/game/create` â€“ start a new human vs AI game.
- `POST /api/game/action` â€“ send shop actions (buy, sell, level, reroll).
- `POST /api/game/{game_id}/ai-turn` â€“ trigger the AIâ€™s shop phase.
- `POST /api/game/{game_id}/combat` â€“ resolve combat for the current round.
- `WS /ws/game/{game_id}` â€“ subscribe to real-time updates (shop refreshes, combat status, AI events).

## Front-end â€“ React Dashboard

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd deck-battler-ui
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the Vite dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Visit the UI at the URL shown in the console (default: <http://localhost:5173>). The dashboard expects the backend to run at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Front-end Features

- Full-screen command center styled with Tailwind.
- Dynamic shop management (reroll, buy, sell, level) with WebSocket-powered updates.
- Combat log stream and side-by-side board visualisation.
- Status bars for HP, gold, streaks, and sect synergies.

## Playing a Match

1. Start both the backend and frontend servers.
2. Open the UI and hit **START GAME**.
3. During the shop phase:
   - Click cards in the shop to buy them (cost and deck capacity enforced).
   - Click your units to sell them for a partial refund.
   - Use **Level Up** (4 gold) and **Reroll** (2 gold) to sculpt your board.
4. Hit **END TURN & FIGHT** to let the AI take its turn and then watch combat.
5. After combat resolves, start the next round to receive income and a fresh shop.

Victory is achieved by reducing the AIâ€™s HP to zero before yours hits zero.

## Reinforcement Learning Toolkit

The repository now ships with a production-ready reinforcement learning stack:

- **`DeckBattlerEnv`** â€“ a Gymnasium-compatible environment that exposes the full player action space (buy, sell, reroll, level, lock, and end-turn). Action masks are provided every step to eliminate illegal moves.
- **`RewardConfig`** â€“ granular reward shaping knobs balancing economy management, board development, and combat performance.
- **`PPOTrainer`** â€“ a battle-tested implementation of Proximal Policy Optimisation with GAE, clipped ratios, entropy regularisation, and gradient norm clipping.
- **`RLTrainingSession`** â€“ one-line orchestration that wires the environment, scripted opponents, and PPO trainer together.
- **Granular telemetry** â€“ every PPO update records actor/value losses, entropy, KL divergence, clip fraction, and value head explained variance so you can chart stability or drive dashboards.

Example training run:

```python
from deck_battler.training import RLTrainingSession
from deck_battler.rl import PPOConfig

config = PPOConfig(rollout_steps=1024, total_updates=200)
session = RLTrainingSession(config=config)
report = session.train(progress_bar=True)

print(f"Mean return: {report.mean_return:.2f}")
print(f"Training history (last 5): {report.history[-5:]}")
print(f"Latest metrics: {report.update_metrics[-1].to_dict()}")
session.save("experiments/ppo_agent.pth")
```

The scripted opponent uses the original heuristic agent but gains support for rerolls and shop locks, giving your learning agent a robust sparring partner out of the box.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Front-end cannot connect to API | Confirm the backend is running on port 8000 and CORS is configured for your origin. |
| WebSocket disconnects immediately | Ensure you are using `ws://localhost:8000/ws/game/{game_id}` and that the game exists. |
| Tailwind classes not applied | Run `npm run dev` inside `deck-battler-ui`; Tailwind compiles on the fly. |
| Reroll button does nothing | You must have at least 2 gold; otherwise the action is rejected and the backend sends an error message. |

## Roadmap Ideas

- Expand the card pool with talents and suppressions alongside units.
- Upgrade the AI to a PPO agent trained via self-play using the provided combat simulator.
- Add analytics overlays (damage charts, synergy matrices) to the UI.
- Persist training runs and deck histories in a database for meta-analysis.
